# CARTE Machine Learning Workshop

## Welcome to the CARTE machine learning workshop!

In this repository, you will find all of the resources you need for the workshop. Each morning and afternoon session is divided into two parts:

1. **Lecture**: This is where you will learn about the theory behind the machine learning algorithms and techniques.
2. **Lab**: This is where you will apply what you learned in the lecture to a real-world problem.

Content will be uploaded to this repository at the beginning of each session. You can access the content by clicking on the links below:
